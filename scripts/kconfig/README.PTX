README.PTX
==========

This is a copy of the linux-2.5.63 scripts/kconfig directory. The only
modification is the Makefile, which comes from an old version of kconfig
(standalone version 1.2, before it was merged with Linux) 
and the kconfig.diff patch. 

To update to a new kconfig version copy the kconfig directory from the kernel
and replace Makefile with that one to be found in ../ptx-modifications and 
apply the patch.
