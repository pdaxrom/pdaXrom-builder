# /etc/hosts -  hostname_to_address mappings for the resolver library
#
# The format is:
#
# ipaddr fully_qualified_hostname list_of_nicknames
#
# We strongly recommend to use a fully qualified hostname for your machine
# if it is connected to any type of network. You can add short nicknames as
# you like, but the official canonical name is the name that follows the
# IP address and should always be a fully qualified hostname.
#
# If you don't have any network interfaces, you should put your hostname
# in the line of your loopback device, which has the address 127.0.0.1.
#
#
# The loopback device. It should always be available.
#
127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain localhost ipaq
#
# Your first IP interface (if you are connected to any kind of network)
#

#
# Your second IP interface (normally for routers only)
#


#
# If you have a nameserver we recommend to use it instead of putting many
# hosts in this file. If you don't have a nameserver though, you can add
# hostnames and their IP addresses below this line.
